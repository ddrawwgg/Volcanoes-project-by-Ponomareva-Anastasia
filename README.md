# Study of Volcanic Eruptions Since the 18th Century

This project explores volcanic eruptions recorded since the 1700s. The notebook analyzes historical data to identify patterns, impacts, and trends associated with volcanic activities over the centuries.

## Overview

The notebook consists of several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of volcanic eruptions:

- Introduction to the study of volcanic eruptions since the 18th century.
- Preprocessing and indexing of eruption data for analysis.
- Examination of data limitations, focusing on records post-1700.
- Analysis of eruption frequencies based on volcano types.
- Correlation between volcano types and associated disasters.
- Identification of top-10 countries with the highest number of eruptions.
- Analysis of countries where eruptions caused the most fatalities.

## Usage

To run this notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Download the dataset required for the analysis.
3. Open the `Ponomareva_proj.ipynb` file in Jupyter.
4. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Data

The analysis is based on volcanic eruption data from the 18th century onwards. The data includes information about eruption dates, types, affected countries, and casualties.
